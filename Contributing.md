## Write an Orca App

Writing an Orca app is a great way to both familiarize yourself with Orca and help us improve it, by discovering bugs and motivating new features. Bug reports, proposals and PRs based on a real use-case are highly appreciated and likely to be prioritized over more abstract feedback. 


## Spread the Word 

You can also help by talking about Orca around you: write a blog post or talk about your project using Orca. Help people getting on board and start their own project. Ultimately Orca's success depends on programmers building and distributing cool apps with it, and it will only happen if they're aware of it. 


## Contribute

Start by cloning the repo and building from source. See [Building](https://docs.orca-app.dev/building/) for instructions. 

Issues labeled as [`good first issue`](https://github.com/orca-app/orca/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22) are intended to be limited in scope and to not require a lot of internal knowledge of Orca. They're a good starting point to familiarize yourself with the internals of Orca.

You can also contribute to the [documentation](https://docs.orca-app.dev) by submitting changes to the docs folder. See [Editing the Documentation](https://docs.orca-app.dev/documentation/) for instructions on how to build and edit the docs website locally.

Don't hesitate to ask questions not covered by the documentation in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/t9GFHbh6) (or in issues discussions). We'll do our best to get you up to speed with the codebase.

## Sponsor

Another way of contributing to Orca's success is to support us financially by donating monthly through [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/orca-app).

## LLM Policy

Don't use LLMs to write issues, comments, or PRs. 

If you use an LLM for searching information, make sure you validate this information with primary sources and testing before using it to write an issue or a PR. If this information contains code, _never_ copy it. Always write _original code_ that you fully understand, and make sure the algorithms and techniques you take inspiration from are not patented or covered by a restrictive license. 

LLM-quality content will be removed at our sole discretion and can result in ban for the author.
